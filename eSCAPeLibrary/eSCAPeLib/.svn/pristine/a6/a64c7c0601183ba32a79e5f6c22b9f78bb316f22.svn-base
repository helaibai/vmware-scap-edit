               of the XCCDF rule and is unaffected by the vulnerability or exposure referenced by
               the CVE.~For a CCE entry, the target platform complies with the configuration setting
               guidance expressed in the XCCDF rule.~For a CPE entry, the target platform was identified
               on the system.~It is important that these interpretations of &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; elements
               be preserved. For example, consider two policy recommendations. One is that a particular
               piece of software be installed, and the second that another piece of software not
               be installed. Both rules for these policy recommendations could use the same CPE entry
               in their &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; elements. However, because the interpretation of a CPE entry
               is that a "pass" result indicates software was installed, the second policy recommendation's
               rule would violate this. This can be corrected by using the @con:negate attribute,
               a Boolean attribute that inverts the rule result. The second rule could check for
               the software being installed and then negate that result, thus giving a result consistent
               in meaning with the first rule. For rules that cannot have their interpretations preserved
               through the use of the @con:negate attribute, an alternative is to have a CCE entry
               corresponding to the recommendation. Rules that do not use &lt;xccdf:ident&gt; elements
               have no such restrictions.
