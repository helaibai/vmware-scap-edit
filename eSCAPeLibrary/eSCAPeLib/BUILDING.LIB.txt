This project is configured to be built using maven2. 

An earlier release of eSCAPe and eSCAPeLib required some external maven artifacts (jars) to be manually added 
to your local maven repository. The maven pom.xml files have been changed to eliminate this requirement. 
A copy of the SCAP Validation tool is now inside eSCAPeLib, so its dependencies are no longer required to 
be in the maven repository.

We'll assume you've checked out the eSCAPeLib project into a directory called /foo

You can check out eSCAPeLib from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/escapelibrary/

cd /foo/eSCAPeLib
mvn clean install

All jars needed needed by the maven build will be downloaded automatically by maven.
