This project is configured to be built using maven. 

You will need to have maven 3 installed and configured to build properly.

We'll assume you've unzipped both the eSCAPe and eSCAPeLib project into a directory called /workspace

First build eSCAPeLib:
cd /workspace/eSCAPeLib
mvn clean install

Second build eSCAPe:
cd /workspace/eSCAPe
mvn clean install

You can also use either eclipse or NetBeans to greatly simplify working with these projects. The files 
that you unzipped have .project, .classpath, and nbactions.xml (which will need some work).  NetBeans 
is especially important to make changes to the swing gui panels.
