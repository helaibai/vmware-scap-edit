			<title>System Requirements</title>
			<para>In order to run eSCAPe your system will need to meet the following requirements:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>A <emphasis>JVM<indexterm><primary>Java Virtual Machine</primary><secondary>Java Runtime Environment</secondary><tertiary>JRE</tertiary></indexterm> of version 1.6 or later must be installed.</emphasis></para>
				</listitem>

					<para><emphasis>The system should have at least 1GB of memory.</emphasis></para>

			<title>Installation and launch</title>
			<para>In the place you extracted the installation archive, you should find startEditor.bat and startEditor.sh.  These files can be used to start eSCAPe.  They will call Java with the appropriate arguments.   These can be edited if you need to give Java more memory or set some other system property.  But do not edit these unless you have to. </para>
			<para>On windows you can browse to the directory containing startEditor.bat and double-click it to launch eSCAPe.  On non-windows platforms, you can use the convention of that system to launch the startEditor.sh file.  Once started, you should see the main window that looks like the following:

		<section><title>Creating a new OVAL document</title>
			<para>With the editor open you can proceed to open the &quot;File&quot; menu and select &quot;New Oval&quot;.  The first screen will ask you pick the target schema version.  Newer versions of oval support more platforms and more test types.  The version you pick here should be the highest one that your target scanner will support.  Many SCAP-validated tools only support 5.3 at the time of this writing.	
			</para>
			<para><inlinegraphic format="JPG" fileref="img/new_oval_wizard_schema_ver.jpg" align="left" valign="top"/></para>
			<para>Clicking next on the wizard will bring you to the platforms page.   Here you should select the platforms you wish to support with your oval document.  New platforms can be added later, so just select the one or two you are most interested for now.</para>
			<para><inlinegraphic fileref="img/new_oval_wizard_platforms.jpg" format="JPG" align="left" valign="top"/></para>
			<para>The last page of the wizard will ask you to choose a file to write the new oval document to.  Once you have chosen a file, click &quot;Finish&quot; to complete the wizard.  The new oval document will be opened for editing.</para>

			<title>Creating a new XCCDF benchmark from an OVAL document</title>
			<para>Most SCAP scanners are unable to run a scan based on just the OVAL document.  Many of them require that you have an XCCDF benchmark &quot;wrapper&quot; that has rules that point to the OVAL definitions you want to run.  eSCAPe has a wizard for producing an XCCDF benchmark for exactly this purpose.</para>
			<para>With the editor open and an OVAL document open you can proceed to open the &quot;File&quot; menu and select &quot;New XCCDF from OVAL&quot;.  Simply fill in the required fields and click &quot;Finish&quot;.  A new XCCDF benchmark will be created in the	same directory as the OVAL document you have open in the editor.  This new benchmark will be opened for editing as soon as the wizard completes.</para>

			<title>Creating a new CPE<indexterm><primary>SCAP Specifications</primary><secondary>Common Platform Enumeration</secondary></indexterm> dictionary</title>
			<para>A CPE dictionary provides a way to specify names for commonly used platforms or programs. Each item also alows you to point to OVAL definitions that can validate if that CPE item applies to the running system.</para>
			<para>With the editor open you can proceed to open the &quot;File&quot; menu and select &quot;New CPE dictionary&quot;.  The wizard will appear and you will need to pick the specific version of CPE you would like to use for your new dictionary.  Unless you have a specific need to go to an earlier version, pick the default, which is the latest.  You will also need to pick the filename you want to save the new dictionary as.  After you have done this, click &quot;Finish&quot;.</para>

			<title>Validating an open document</title>
			<para>The eSCAPe tool makes it very easy to see if your content is valid according to the schema.</para>
			<para>While a document is open go to the &quot;Tools&quot; menu an select the &quot;Validate&quot; menu item.  If the document is not valid, a window showing what validation errors there are will appear.  Simply run the validation again when you have fixed all the errors to see that they are gone.</para>

					<entry>Stands for Common Platform Enumeration.  CPE is an attempt at standardizing the way platforms, be they operating systems or applications, are referred to.  Common names are stored in a CPE dictionary.  Dictionary entries can be pointed at OVAL definitions that contain the logic necessary to check whether that dictionary entry applies to the current system or not.  See

					<entry>Stands for Security Content Automation Protocol.  SCAP represents a 							suite of XML document specifications and other standards used in trying 							to develop a common way to assess compliance and vulnerability issues.  						Specifications like XCCDF, OVAL, CCE, CPE, CVE, and CVSS used in 							concert allow policy makers and sysadmins alike to assess their systems 						for compliance and vulnerability in a standard, non-proprietary way.

					<entry>Stands for the eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format.  An XCCDF benchmark defines a number of rules who generally reference definitions in an OVAL document.  Rules can be grouped together in a number of different ways and are usually selected by a profile under the benchmark.
