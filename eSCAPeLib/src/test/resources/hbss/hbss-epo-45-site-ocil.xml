         <title>(U) A static IP address exists for the ePO server.</title>
         <description>(U) Navigate to the ‘Start/Settings/ControlPanel/NetworkConnections’ and choose the ‘Local Area Network’ connection. From the ‘General’ tab, select ‘Properties’, and then select the ‘Internet Protocol’ (TCP/IP). Click the ‘Properties’ button. Ensure that an IP address is present, and that the ‘Obtain an IP address’ is not checked. If there is more than one Network Connection – all of the IPs addresses should be checked for compliance. If a static IP address is not assigned, this is a finding.</description><!--V-14282-->

         <title>(U) The ePO server is located in a protected Enclave Security Services DMZ or screened subnet.</title>
         <description>(U) Validate the scope of clients that the ePO server is servicing. If the ePO is servicing clients outside the local enclave, the requirement is that the ePO server must be in a protected Security Services Enclave DMZ (and not part of the public DMZ.) Review the network topology diagram. Check the ePO server IP address and subnet mask to validate that it is in the documented subnet for the non-public DMZ. (A network diagram must be available – or the checks should be done by looking at the firewall controlling the DMZ). If the ePO server is not in a Security Services Enclave DMZ, this is a finding. If it is in a public DMZ, this is a finding. If the ePO server is only serving clients inside the local enclave, the requirement is to be in a separate controlled access subnet and not part of the public DMZ that houses the public web servers. In addition, it needs to be isolated via a controlled access mechanism from the local general population LAN. Review the network topology diagram. Check the ePO IP address and subnet mask to validate that it is in the documented subnet for the non-public DMZ. Also, validate that it is in a controlled access subnet that is isolated from the general population LAN. The checks can be done by looking at a network diagram, or by looking at the network infrastructure devices controlling the network. If the ePO server is in a public DMZ, this is a finding. If the ePO server is not isolated from the general population LAN, this is a finding.</description><!--V-14483-->

         <title>(U//FOUO) The ePO server’s management workstations, outside the enclave, use NIST certified encrypted VPNs for access and the traffic is logged.</title>
         <description>(U//FOUO) For the scenario where management (i.e., system or database administration) traffic must cross a DoD boundary, a VPN must be used to encapsulate and encrypt the remote access traffic using NIST certified encryption. The VPN must terminate at the firewall. An audit record of each session must also be logged. Verify if there are remote connections from outside the ePO's enclave. If there is not, this check should be considered NA. If there are, verify that this traffic is encapsulated and encrypted within the VPN tunnel, and the traffic is logged. In addition, the VPN must either translate remote console into specific IP addresses or designate a pool of IP addresses for remote consoles. If there is no VPN, this is a finding. If the VPN connection does not terminate at the firewall, this is a finding. If the session is not logged, this is a finding. If the IP address translation of remote console is not done via a designated pool of IP addresses or has dedicated IP assignments for them, this is a finding.</description><!--V-14484-->

         <description>(U//FOUO) This requirement is looking for the protection at the local enclave perimeter. It can be fulfilled by using any network protection except the local host-based firewall. Please refer to the Network Infrastructure STIG for additional guidance about perimeter protection. Ensure that there is a deny by default access control list (ACL) both inbound and outbound within the perimeter protecting the ePO server. If there is not, this is a finding. The only inbound allowable exceptions are as follows: VPN Client addresses (from the VPN concentrator). IP addresses (or ranges) of clients with specific ports inbound to the ePO server from outside the perimeter are permitted if they are being serviced by this ePO server. The only outbound allowable exceptions are as follows: Outbound-initiated traffic to access updates (DoD download servers) and only specific ports. (There will not be an allowance for IP addresses for this function without port restrictions.) Outbound-initiated traffic for updates and wakeup calls to serviced clients is allowed (including updates to distributed repositories).</description><!--V-14486-->

         <description>(U) Verify that the traffic into the ePO server is visible to the local network IDS. If there is no local network IDS in place, this is a finding. Note: This cannot be closed or considered Not a Finding via the host-based product on the local ePO server. Note: The intent of this finding is to ensure traffic flowing to the ePO server is being monitored by the device that is already required or point out that the enclave does not have an IDS. In most cases, the ePO server will be on a screened subnet. As long as the interface for that subnet is being monitored, that will meet the intent of the finding.</description><!--V-14488-->

         <description>(U//FOUO) Verify that the server has been registered in the Ports and Protocols database (https://pnp.cert.smil.mil) for the site. If it is not registered, this is a finding. Verify the following ports are registered: 4.0 --------------- Agent-to-server: 80 (HTTP) Agent wake-up: 591 Agent broadcast: 8082 Event parser-to-application: 8445 Sensor-to-server: 8443 Console-to-application: 443 4.5 --------------- Agent-to-server: 80 (HTTP) / 443 (HTTPS) Agent wake-up: 591 Agent broadcast: 8082 Event parser-to-application: 8445 Sensor-to-server: 8443 Console-to-application: 8005 Console-to-application (PKI): 8007 Note: PM registration of the ports does not indicate compliance.

         <description>(U) Review the documented configuration management process for HBSS. The process must document and approve both configuration changes to the ePO server, as well as policy updates that are being applied to clients. This process also needs to include the exceptions to policy and alerts. Process must include a site Configuration Control Board (CCB). If a documented configuration management plan does not exist, this is a finding. If a documented configuration management plan exists and does not contain a CCB, this is a finding.</description><!--V-14491-->

Note: If this is a disconnected network, this requirement can be met via the use of a manual distribution. The process must be documented and adhered to and must meet the requirements for frequency as defined in this document. Note: If the ePO server is outside of the .mil address space (such as, .edu, .gov, etc.), connection to the DoD-controlled servers for updates will not be possible and, in this case, updates from the vendor are acceptable and this check should be marked NA.</description><!--V-14493-->

         <description>(U//FOUO) All of the following checks must be true in order for the check to be considered Not a Finding: The firewall must be in deny by default for bi-directional traffic. Explicit rule must exist to only allow inbound TCP on Port 8005 (SPIPE) from the ePO Server and remote console IP addresses (or remote console IP addresses from the VPN Concentrator pool) using user authentication. Explicit rule must exist to only allow inbound TCP on Port 8007 (SPIPE) from the ePO Server and remote console IP addresses (or remote console IP addresses from the VPN Concentrator pool) using PKI authentication. Explicit rule to only allow inbound TCP on Port 80 and 443 from IP Ranges of clients serviced by the ePO server. (SPIPE) Explicit rule to only allow outbound TCP on Port 591 (SPIPE – Agent wakeup calls) to clients being serviced by the ePO server and Super Agent Distributed Repository IP addresses. Inbound only from itself. Explicit rule for WSUS updates to the DoD HBSS WSUS site, if it is being used, when approved. ***All other rules present must be explicitly identified by scope and purpose. If any of these items are not compliant, this is a finding. Note: The IP address of the site’s vulnerability scanner can be configured to allow all ports – but it must be restricted by IP for the vulnerability scanner IP only and the rule can only be active when there is an actual scheduled scan in process. Refer to checks H36220, H36260, and H40220 as to additional requirements for scanning the ePO server. If running ePO in a virtual environment and if the hosting platform has either inbound or outbound access to the Internet, this is a finding. If the firewall does not have explicit IP definitions for port 1433, this is a CAT I finding. If H20200: HBSS Specific Perimeter Defense, was a finding and the host firewall is not in a deny by default configuration for bidirectional traffic, this is a CAT I finding.</description><!--V-14495-->

         <description>(U) Verify with the IAO and ePO administrators that the clients being serviced by the HBSS ePO server are from a single classification level and are not servicing clients from DoD information systems operating at different classification levels. Additionally there is no mixing of information from DoD and non-DoD systems or networks. Note: Non-DoD systems or networks (for this check) refers to the systems that are owned and controlled by a non-DoD agency or contractor that may, or may not, reside within DoD space.</description><!--V-14496-->

Search for other applications (such as Office products) or other management products (such as WSUS application or Hercules Server Application, etc.). If there are any other applications installed or running on this machine, this is a finding. Note: If the machine has multiple images in a virtual environment, this check can be satisfied by having a logically dedicated image or a thin client solution. Note: If the platform is being remotely managed, management software is permitted. See H30620 for the requirements of the machine to be used for remote management of the platform. Note: HBSS components/add-ons can be present on the server.</description><!--V-14497-->

               <description>For all existing/active systems, all organizations must perform a malware/spyware scan no more than one week before the installation of the HBSS client. This scan will include full anti-virus scans and scans for known bad hashes on all hosts before loading the HBSS client. This requirement is to minimize the chance of deploying the HBSS client on a host that already contains malware. If scans were not performed or there is no process to scan before installation on existing hosts, this is a finding. (See H90300 for requirement of installation on new hosts.)</description>
